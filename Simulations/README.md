This directory contains all the code for simulating yields under different fertilizer scenarios.

Simulate them by calling findCornVCR(model, numYears, FertScenario)

model = 1, 2, or 3 and corresponds to MaizeModel1.txt, MaizeModel2.txt and MaizeModel3.txt
numYears is the number of simulated years
FertScenario is a vector of fertilizer application scenarios, where each element is an application amount in kg/ha
